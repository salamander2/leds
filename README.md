leds
====

Introductory Python programs for controlling LEDs using a Raspberry Pi (for my workshop)

To copy all of these programs, type `git clone https://github.com/salamander2/leds` . This will make a folder called "leds" in your current dicrectory and put the programs in it.

For the repository that contains everything, please go to the one called "RaspberryPi" https://github.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi
