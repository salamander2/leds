leds
====

Introductory Python programs for controlling LEDs using a Raspberry Pi (for my workshop)

### Build this circuit first

* With this circuit you can run all of the programs in this repository.
* To copy all of these programs, type 

**<pre>git clone https://github.com/salamander2/leds</pre>**

This will make a folder called "leds" in your current dicrectory and put the programs in it.

* Type `cd leds` to change directory.
* Type `ls -l` to see a listing of the programs.
* Type `sudo python light2.py` to run program 2.

=====
You can also run the the "Pulse2.py" program which will pulse the two LEDS using PWM mode.

### Add the 3 colour LED

Now you can run the TriColour program "Tricolour.py". Press 'r', 'g', and 'b' keys to increase the red, green, and blue.  Use capital R G B to decrease the amounts.

### Bigger and Better Things ...
For the repository that contains everything, please go to the one called "RaspberryPi" https://github.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi
