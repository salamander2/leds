leds
====

Introductory Python programs for controlling LEDs using a Raspberry Pi (for my workshop)

### Build this circuit first

* With this circuit you can run all of the programs in this repository.
* To copy all of these programs, type 

**git clone https://github.com/salamander2/leds**

This will make a folder called "leds" in your current dicrectory and put the programs in it.
* You can also run the the "pulse2.py" program in RaspberryPi/programs/Flasher  (it's in the same folder as the Flasher program). Get it using this command: 

**wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/Flasher/Pulse2.py**

### Add the 3 colour LED

* Now you can run the TriColour program in the RaspberryPi/programs/Tricolour folder

**wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/TriColour/TriColour.py**

### Bigger and Better Things ...
For the repository that contains everything, please go to the one called "RaspberryPi" https://github.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi
